A few of the files have 

"$host = 'localhost'; // Database host
$dbname = 'your_database_name'; // Database name
$username = 'your_username'; // Database username
$password = 'your_password'; // Database password"
Please fill in these with the required.

Feel free to edit the files as they are all basic - and there might be glitches/bugs in the code.
You could also give styles.css a bit of a ramp up and add the stylesheet onto more pages - right now it is 
only on register.php and login.php.
The captcha might not work - if so, feel free to delete it. Most of this code is only for testing so is 
likely to need a large edit, but it might be ok.
The index.php and about.php files are both demo files - they are very basic and will need more styling and
designing for publishing purposes.
For now, the website has adopted the name " Over And Out" - this name cannot be edited for now.
There is no legal documentation associated with the register/login so if possible, you might need to 
research into creating those.

Good luck,
Alex
